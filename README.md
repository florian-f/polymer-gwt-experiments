# polymer-gwt-experiments

This is a minimal sample gwt app that uses polymer.

I'm not exaggerating when I say that it's simple, it's literally just displaying a button with an icon and nothing else (no databinding or other fancy stuff).

My plan is to use this as a starting point for exploring gwt with polymer. 

## build

- you need to cd to war and run bower update

- edit the build.xml and include the proper path to your gwt build (I built trunk yesterday)

-   ant build
